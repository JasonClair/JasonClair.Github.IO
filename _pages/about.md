I am a IT Professional based in Teesside, England. I primarily work with Microsoft Dynamics 365, SharePoint and .NET but I do like to branch out into other technologies.

I started this blog as a way to document interesting challenges I've come across and how I've (hopefully) solved them. Hopefully the information on this blog saves someone some time when they encounter similar issues.

If you'd like to discuss anything on the blog or contact me for some help, please use the form below:

## Certifications

I have completed several Microsoft certifications. Please see my profile on [Your Acclaim](https://www.youracclaim.com/users/jason-clair){:target="blank"} for more information.
